Data used to train this model comes from the  Alzheimerâ€™s   Disease
    Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu). As
    such, the investigators within the ADNI contributed to the design
    and implementation of ADNI and/or provided data but did not
    participate in analysis or writing of this report. A complete
    listing of ADNI investigators can be found at: http://adni.loni.usc.edu/wp-
